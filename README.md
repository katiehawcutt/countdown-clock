# Countdown Timer

###### April 2020

### Things I learnt / experimented with in this project:

- I used const for the first time! (only used var up until now)
- More use of setTimeout
- Counting down instead of up so had to make sure it stopped at 0! (used an if / else statement)
- Bit of styling and use of animation for the finish!
